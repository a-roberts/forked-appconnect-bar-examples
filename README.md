# forked-appconnect-bar-examples

Hi, this repository is forked from https://github.com/amarIBM/hello-world and it contains a simple HTTP Echo BAR that is used in a blog post. The specific BAR file has been tested with App Connect 12.0.9.0-r2 operands on App Connect as a Service only.

No guarantees can be made about the BAR file being super awesome, or secure, or production ready - ideally you will use your own BAR file with your own repository; this is just an example.
